<h3>Documenting of Redefined Components</h3>

A schema component may <i>redefine</i> other component when it is declared within
an XSD <code>&lt;xs:redefine&gt;</code> element.
When the XML schema, which is being redefined by this element, also contains a component with that name,
such a component becomes <i>redefined</i>.
It will be completely replaced by the <i>redefining</i> component within the namespace scope targeted by the schema.
<p>
The redefining component is typically based on the original component it redefines (it just extends or restricts it).
Because of this, DocFlex/XML XSDDoc will document both components.
