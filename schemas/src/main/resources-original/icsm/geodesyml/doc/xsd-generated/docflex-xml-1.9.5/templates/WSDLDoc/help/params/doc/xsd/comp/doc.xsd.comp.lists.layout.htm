This parameter controls how the list items are displayed.
<p>
<u>Possible Choices</u>:
<p>
<i>"flow"</i>
<dl><dd>
The list items will appear as a comma delimited text flow within a single paragraph.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
This layout produces a very compact representation of the list. However,
it may be rather difficult to read, especially when some items contain spaces.
</dd></dl>

<i>"one column"</i>
<dl><dd>
The list will be printed in a single column: each item on a separate line. 
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
This layout suits best for the lists containing long strings (particularly with spaces).
</dd></dl>

<i>"two columns"</i>
<dl><dd>
The list items will be arranged in a two-column table.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
This representation suits more for the lists, whose items include strings with spaces.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
However, when the list contains long strings, the two-column table may stretch
far beyond the visible (printable) page width. 
In that case, the <i>one-column</i> layout suits better.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
Also, the two-column layout may be not very good for big lists made of short word items
(because it will occupy too much space).
In that case the <i>flow</i> layout may fit better.
</dd></dl>

<i>"optimal"</i>
<dl><dd>
This choice allows for the list layout to be selected automatically
during the generation so as to represent each particular list in both the most dense
and readable form. (This is programmed in templates.)
</dd></dl>
