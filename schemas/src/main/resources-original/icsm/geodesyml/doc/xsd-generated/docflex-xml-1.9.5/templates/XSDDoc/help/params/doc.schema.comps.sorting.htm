With this parameter you can specify the sorting order of components.
<p>
The parameter has the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>
  When the parameter is selected (<b><code>true</code></b>),
  the components will be sorted alphabetically by their names (ignoring letter case).
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  The component name is assumed to be that under which the component appears 
  (is referenced to) at the given documentation location.
  This is typically the component qualified name (which is the actual namespace prefix 
  plus the component local name). That, however, can be changed using 
  <i>"Show | Namespace Prefixes"</i> parameter.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  Additionally, in the case of a <i>local element</i>, the component name may also include
  a special extension used to distinguish the equally named local elements.
  For more details about this, please see <i>"Show | Local Element Extensions"</i> parameter.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10pt">
  When the parameter is unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>),
  the components will follow in the same order as they are defined in the XML schema.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  This gives you a possibility to specify a particular ordering of the components (e.g. elements)
  by yourself. For instance, simply define the most important components 
  (e.g. an XML document's root element) on the top of the XML schema.
  Then, they will appear the first in the component summary.
</li>
</ul>
