Using this parameter, you can filter out some WSDL/XSD files from those initially selected
with the parameters above.
<p>
Each excluded file should be specified with its name (the last name in the pathname's name sequence, e.g. "xml.xsd").
Multiple file names are separated with the item separator (';' or newline).
<p>
<b>Note:</b> 
This parameter overrides the <i>"Include"</i> parameter (above).
That is, when a WSDL/XSD file is specified in both <i>"Include"</i> and <i>"Exclude"</i>
parameters, it will be excluded from the documentation scope.
