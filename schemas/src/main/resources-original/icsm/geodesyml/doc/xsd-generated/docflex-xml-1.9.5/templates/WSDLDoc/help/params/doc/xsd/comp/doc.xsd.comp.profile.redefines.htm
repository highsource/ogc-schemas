<h3>Documenting of Redefined Components</h3>

A schema component may <i>redefine</i> other component when it is declared within
an XSD <code>&lt;xs:redefine&gt;</code> element.
When the XML schema, which is being redefined by this element,
also contains a component with that name, such a component becomes <i>redefined</i>. 
It will be completely replaced by the <i>redefining</i> component within the namespace scope targeted by the schema.
