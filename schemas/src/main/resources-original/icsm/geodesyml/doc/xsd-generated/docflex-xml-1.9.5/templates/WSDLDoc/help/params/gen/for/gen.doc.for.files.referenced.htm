Specify whether to document the WSDL/XSD files referenced from other files by either
<code>&lt;wsdl:import&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;xs:import&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;xs:include&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;xs:redefine&gt;</code> elements.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> When a WSDL/XSD file is both specified initially on the command line
and referenced from another file, it is loaded only once as the <i>initial</i> file.
However, it will be marked as <i>referenced</i> file as well.
