Specifies whether to remove all <b><code>&lt;xs:annotation&gt;</code></b> elements
from the reproduced XML source of the whole schema.
<p>
You may want to exclude the <code>&lt;xs:annotation&gt;</code> elements from the reproduced XML source
because such elements may occupy a lot of space (especially, when you use XHTML to format your annotations),
so they could overwhelm anything else making it difficult to read other important things.
Moreover, the actual content of the <code>&lt;xs:annotation&gt;</code> elements may be already shown
(as a formatted text) in the corresponding <i>Annotation</i> sections of the documentation.
