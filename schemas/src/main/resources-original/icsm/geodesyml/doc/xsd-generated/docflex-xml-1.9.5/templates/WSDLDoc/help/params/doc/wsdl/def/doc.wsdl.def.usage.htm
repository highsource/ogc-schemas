Specify whether to generate the detailed <b><i>Usage Locations</i></b> report (section).
<p>
Although most of WSDL definitions are used somewhere in the same WSDL file,
this report can be generated only for WSDL messages. 
That's because in case of other WSDL definitions, their usage is typically very trivial,
so it can be already seen in the <i>"Definition Profile | Used"</i> section.
