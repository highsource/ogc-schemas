Specify which version of XMLSpy Java API will be used to communicate with XMLSpy.
<p>
<u>Possible Choices</u>:
<p>
<i>"early version"</i>
<dl><dd>
The early version of XMLSpy Java API, which existed all the time since the very start.
It is based on the files:
<dl><dd>
<code style="white-space:nowrap">
  C:\Program Files\Altova\XMLSpy\XMLSpyInterface.jar<br>
  C:\Windows\system32\XmlSpyLib.dll
</code>
</dd></dl>
This API is currently most stable and should be preferred (particularly on Windows).
So it is the default choice.
</dd></dl>

<i>"2012"</i>
<dl><dd>
A new API provided since XMLSpy 2012.
It is based on the files found in the directory:
<dl><dd>
  <code style="white-space:nowrap">C:\Program Files\Altova\XMLSpy\JavaAPI\</code>
</dd></dl>
Namely:
<dl><dd>
<code style="white-space:nowrap">
  XMLSpyAPI.jar<br>
  AltovaAutomation.jar<br>
  AltovaAutomation.dll
</code>
</dd></dl>

As of the XMLSpy v2012, the problem of this API is that it raises
some internal Java exception when quitting XMLSpy.
However, that exception is tolerable and can be ignored in most cases.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
We don't know the reason why Altova has created another Java API for XMLSpy.
But it may be expected that the new API will be given a priority in the next XMLSpy version.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
So, if something doesn't work with some new XMLSpy version (since 2012),
you may try to switch to this API.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
The same we suggest, if you have problem of running the XMLSpy integration on
<a href="http://www.winehq.org">Linux/Wine</a>.
