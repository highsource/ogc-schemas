Specify the possible scope of the type declaration for which the <i>"Type Detail"</i> section may be generated.

<p>
<u>Possible Values</u>:
<p>
<i>"anonymous"</i>
<dl><dd>
The type details may be generated only in the case of an anonymous type.
(The <i>anonymous type</i> is the one that is defined directly within the definition of the element component.)
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
This is the default setting because the (non-anonymous) global types are supposed to be documented separately.
</dd></dl>

<i>"any"</i>
<dl><dd>
The type details should be generated for any element type (regardless of its declaration scope).
</dd></dl>
