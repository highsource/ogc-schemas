  <b>Elimination of &ldquo;DocFlex/XML RE&rdquo;</b>
  <p>
  The lite edition of DocFlex/XML (called &ldquo;DocFlex/XML RE&rdquo;) has been eliminated.
  <p>
  <table><tr><td class="note">
    The reason is that by the time the lite edition has evolved into the same as the full one,
    except it included no Template Designer.
    Since currently different features of DocFlex/XML software are licensed separately anyway, no matter where they reside,
    the lite edition is redundant -- just draws resources to maintain it.
  </td></tr></table>
  <p>
  Now, only the full edition of DocFlex/XML (called simply &ldquo;DocFlex/XML&rdquo;) is available,
  which includes all features/functionality developed in this product line
  (however, grouped in different <a href="http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/#products">logical products</a> with separate licensing).
  <p>
  <table><tr><td class="note">
    If you have been using DocFlex/XML RE, now simply install and use the full edition.
    Equally, install your licenses there. Everything else is the same.

  <b>New &ldquo;<a href="doc/index.html?docflex-xml/wsdldoc/overview.html">WSDLDoc</a>&rdquo; template set</b>
  <p>
  Now, DocFlex/XML includes one more big template applications
  called &ldquo;<a href="doc/index.html?docflex-xml/wsdldoc/overview.html">WSDLDoc</a>&rdquo;,
  which implements a powerful WSDL/XSD documentation generator.
  Made of 100 templates and controlled by 700+ parameters, it is the most complex end-user application
  of the whole <a href="http://www.filigris.com/docflex/">DocFlex Technology</a> to date!
  <p>
  See: <a href="templates/WSDLDoc/README.html"><code>templates/WSDLDoc/README.html</code></a>

    <a name="v1.9.5_template_param_defs"></a>
    <b><i>New template parameter definition editor</i></b>
    <p>
    The editor of template parameter definitions (found in the Template Property Dialog | <i>Parameter</i> tab) has been completely reworked.
    <p>
    Previously, that was just the plain list with each line representing a parameter.
    As the number of parameters in some templates has grown to enormous quantity, that list eventually became practically unnavigable.
    <p>
    Now, the parameter definitions are represented in the form of tree with collapsible nodes
    (the same as in Parameter Inspector). Thereby, the usability of the parameter definition editor has been restored.

  <ul>
  <li>
    <a name="v1.9.5_multiple_schemas"></a>
    <b><i>XML files described by multiple XML schemas</i></b>
    <p>
    Some XML files may be described not by a single but by several XML schemas at once.
    For instance, the XML file as a whole (starting from the root element) is described by one XML schema,
    but some internal parts of it -- by another XML schema (even completely unrelated to the first one).
    <p>
    <table><tr><td class="note">
      That's actually the case of WSDL files.
      A WSDL 1.1 file as a whole is described by the schema: <code>http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/</code>.
      But the <code>&lt;wsdl:definitons&gt;/&lt;wsdl:types&gt;</code> element typically contains
      one or many XML schemas embedded in that WSDL file, which are described by a different schema:
      <code>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.xsd</code>
    </td></tr></table>
    <p>
    Now, DocFlex/XML is able to work with such XML files. XML schemas drive the whole data processing in DocFlex/XML.
    They are used by both Template Designer and Template Interpreter.
    <p>
    That capability is critical for <a href="#v1.9.5_wsdldoc">WSDLDoc</a> template set.

  <li>
    <a name="v1.9.5_rtf_ehtml_repeating_whitespace"></a>
    <b><i>Elimination of repeating whitespace in embedded HTML</i></b>
    <p>
    When a text (e.g. XML schema annotations) preformatted with HTML tags contains repeating whitespace (i.e. space and newline characters),
    those repeatings won't appear in the generated RTF output (the same it would be in case of HTML browsers).
    <p>
    That was not provided before this version.

  <li>
    <a name="v1.9.5_rtf_include_text"></a>
    <b><i>Including static Word document into generated RTF</i></b>
    <p>
    A possibility has been supported to include a static Word document in the RTF document generated by DocFlex.
    That is done through a Data Control with the data source specified as "Document Field".
    A new "Include Text" field has been implemented.
    The included Word document file must be specified with the "Expression for Filename or URL",
    the parameter of that field.

    <i>Template Call</i> is a template component that allows you to call one template from another.
    Here, the called template (or <i>subtemplate</i>) serves as a procedure.
    It may generate either a separate file or a piece of the file generated by the calling template.
    A Template Call has a lot of settings (among them, of course, passing template parameters).

    Now, one more group of settings has been added -- the <b><i>list of style overrides</i></b>.
    <p>
    <table><tr><td class="note">
      Each template may define formatting styles. These are the named groups of formatting properties,
      which can be assigned to a template component at once just by specifying the style name.
      The formatting styles are template local things. That is, they are not imported from somewhere outside.
      But when a template is called from another template, the styles defined in the calling template will override
      the equally named styles defined in the called template. 
      When multiple templates are called one from another, that will work in a chain.
      So, the styles defined in the main template will override any equally named styles defined elsewhere.
      As a whole, formatting styles behave as additional template parameters passed implicitly by their names.
    </td></tr></table>
    <p>
    Now, it is possible also to specify explicitly for a given Template Call
    how the style overriding occurs.
    For each style found in the called template, a <b><i>style override</i></b> can be defined
    that tells exactly which style from the calling template will override it (regardless of the style name).
    That adds a lot more flexibility!
    <p>
    Style overrides are specified in the Template Call property dialog
    on the <i>"Call Settings | Style Overrides"</i> tab.

    <b><i>New HTML Generator</i></b>
    <p>
    The HTML generator has been almost entirely redeveloped to achieve the following goals:
    <ol>
    <li>
      Generation of HTML output fully compatible with one of the two markup standards:
      <a href="#v1.9.0_html401_xhtml1">HTML 4.01 / XHTML 1.0</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      To allow the users to style the generated HTML documentation with their

  <li><a name="v1.9.0_html401_xhtml1"></a>
    <b><i>HTML 4.01 / XHTML 1.0</i></b>
    <p>
    Now, the HTML output can be generated in one of the markups:
    <ul>
    <li>HTML 4.01</li>
    <li>XHTML 1.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The markup is selected with the option:
    <i><a href="#v1.9.0_html.output.markup">Output | Markup</a></i>
    <p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="v1.9.0_custom_CSS"></a>
    <b><i>Custom CSS Rules</i></b>
    <p>
    For those who wanted to customize the generated HTML documentation with their own CSS rules,
    it is possible now!
    <p>
    <table><tr><td class="note">
      Although, such a feature is typically ubiquitous in other doc-generators, to support it in DocFlex
      required some kind of breakthrough.
      <p></p>
      The difference is that a typical doc-generator is developed from the start for a particular 
      destination format (i.e. HTML) in some general programming language (like Java)
      or XSLT, with very meticulous coding
      of how all formatting constructs are generated. All CSS rules are planned beforehand and everything
      is adjusted to them.
      <p></p>
      In DocFlex, the actual doc-generators are programmed in the form of templates,
      where the formatting is specified in a highly abstract way independent on the destination format.
      Then, it is rendered with suitable features available in a selected output format. 
      So, the concept of CSS rules (which is available only in HTML) is somewhat foreign to all this.
    </td></tr></table>
    <p>
    In case of HTML output, the CSS style sheet has been used before, 
    but the CSS rules placed in it were effectively
    the sets of inline CSS properties generated by particular template components and collected together in
    a single style sheet to eliminate their repeating. The class selectors assigned to such CSS rules
    were completely unpredictable and could not be used to substitute the generated CSS rules with the custom ones.
    Such automatic CSS rules are generated now too and called 
    <a href="doc/index.html?general/css_usage.html#anonymous_rules">anonymous CSS rules</a>.
    <p>
    But since this version, a new type of CSS rules has been supported -- 
    <a href="doc/index.html?general/css_usage.html#named_rules">named CSS rules</a>.
    Those are generated from the formatting styles defined in templates. When such a style is assigned to
    a template component, each piece of HTML output (i.e. HTML element) produced by that component
    can be assigned with the CSS rules generated by that style.
    The class selector assigned to a named CSS rule is specified in the corresponding template style.
    So, the relation between a particular CSS class selector and the pieces of output where it is applied
    is predetermined. This makes possible to substitute the CSS rules (i.e. their properties) generated
    for those class selectors automatically, with the custom CSS rules provided by the user.
    <p>
    The difficulty of implementing of named CSS rules comes from the fact that several template styles can
    contribute to the result formatting of a particular template component. The styles can be either assigned directly
    to the component or inherited from its parents. Besides that, some formatting properties can be specified
    on the component directly without any styles at all.
    When that everything is rendered with a single anonymous CSS rule, only effective properties
    (left after all overriding) will get there.
    But when named CSS rules are used, they must replicate in CSS the same property overriding that
    occurs on the level of template styles. That wasn't simple to achieve!

    <b><i>Typecast operator in FlexQuery expressions</i></b>

    The Java-style typecast operator has been supported:
    <blockquote><code>
      (<i>type</i>) obj
    </code></blockquote>
    where <code><i>type</i></code> may be any primitive type (like <code>String</code> or <code>Number</code>)
    or GOM-type ("GOM" stands for Generator Object Model).
    <p>
    It allows you to quickly access properties of various GOM objects,
    provided via untyped references (mostly returned by various functions).
    Now, you can write something like this:
    <blockquote><code>
      ((GOMElement) getParam("name")).id
    </code></blockquote>
    Previously, only special type-conversion functions (like <code>toString()</code> or <code>toElement()</code>)
    were available for such operations.
    <p>
    Casting to array types is also supported. You can write:
    <blockquote><code>
      (<i>type</i>[]) obj
    </code></blockquote>
    At that, the necessary conversion will be done even when the initially <code>obj</code> is an array 
    of a more generic type, however, containing only elements of the required type. For example:
    <blockquote><pre>
objects = Array (1, 2, 3);  // create an Object[] array with only integer elements
ints = (int[]) objects;     // convert it to an array of integers
ints[0] * ints[1] * ints[2] // access array elements as integers</pre>

    This feature is most interesting in the case of <i>element images</i>, which are certain graphical
    depictions (e.g. some diagrams) of the entities represented by the DSM elements.
    <p>

    <a name="v1.8.6_images_and_hyperlinks_in_txt"></a>
    <b><i>Generation of images and hyperlinks in plain-text output</i></b>
    <p>
    It may sound odd. What images and hyperlinks can exist in plain-text files?
    <p>
    Yet, the plain-text output may be just a base layer for other file formats, for instance DITA, which is an XML-based markup.
    There, both images and hyperlinks do exist and are required.
    <p>
    The following new functionality will allow you to use plain-text output capability of DocFlex/XML
    to generate some full-blown complex formats even when they are not supported by DocFlex/XML directly.
    <p>
    <u>Images</u>
    <p>
    In plain-text mode, an Image Control will produce the same image file (according to its setting).
    However, in addition, it also emits into the main output the image file's relative pathname.
    That pathname is calculated against the main file's location and the name-separator is UNIX style ("/").
    In a template, you can surround the Image Control with other Text Controls generating some markup,
    so everything would produce both the image file and the image tag for it in the main output.
    <p>
    <u>Hyperlinks</u>
    <p>
    Now, you can generate cross-hyperlinks in plain-text files too. This equally includes the hyperlinks from images
    (the imagemaps).
    <p>
    What a hyperlink actually is depends on the final format you generate using the plain-text output.
    DocFlex/XML just provides the necessary functionality to find the things you want to link from and to.
    This is implemented in the form of new FlexQuery functions and GOM types/properties ("GOM" stands for
    <i>Generator Object Model</i>):
    <p>

    <b><i>Template calls as stock-sections</i></b>
    <p>
    Template calls are the template components that invoke processing of other templates from the given one
    (typically to insert their output into the currently generated document).
    <p>
    Processing of a template call is rather time-consuming.
    The fewer of them are in a template the better they can be optimized.
    Moreover, templates cannot be called directly from FlexQuery expressions.
    <p>
    The solution is to use stock-sections as light-weight proxies of template calls
    (stock-sections can be called also from FlexQuery expressions).
    That is, a template call is defined only once within a stock-section, and then
    that stock-section is called from anywhere, instead of the template.
    <p>
    Previously, that was possible only by defining a <i>Folder</i> stock-section and
    the <i>Template Call Section</i> within it.
    <p>
    Now, a Template Call Section itself can be specified as stock-section
    (which, of course, reduces all the processing).

    <b><i>'Any Data Source' DSM Type</i></b>
    <p>

    <p>
    <table><tr><td class="note">
      In DocFlex/XML, DSM Type is called <i>XML Type</i>, since all data sources are typically XML files.
    </td></tr></table>
    </p>
    Now, a special DSM Type has been supported: <i>Any Data Source</i>.
    <p>
    A template based on it can be called to process any data source (or even no data source at all).
    It can be called also from any other templates.
    This, however, comes to a price. Such a template can do little more but process only template parameters
    and <code>#CUSTOM</code> elements.
    <p>
    Anyway, it might be useful. For instance, you can create a template that inserts in the output some complex
    richly formatted messages, which are the same for all template applications.
    It is also possible to pass quite complex data via template parameters (and even iterate by them).

    <ul>
    <li>
    The new lines in string constants and FlexQuery expressions are stored now directly in template files
    (not encoded as <code>'\n'</code> escapes).
    </li>

    All template files are written now in UTF-8 encoding. This allows you to see/edit any non-ASCII characters directly
    in templates (without numeric escapes <code>'\uxxxx'</code>).

    <table><tr><td class="note">

    </td></tr></table>
    </p>
    This allows you to assign to templates a different XML Type, which may be derived from the initial one.

      All changes of the template file format (above) are fully compatible with the old templates.

    Expression Assistant provides a dynamic help system when writing FlexQuery-expression
    (those used to calculate various dynamic properties of template components and for other things).
    <p>
    As the number of FlexQuery-functions constantly increases (many actually overload
    the same functionality with different parameter signatures), the function tree
    in the Expression Assistant has been reorganized as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>
    All functions with the same name, which are to be shown on the given branch of the tree,
    are grouped in a single node with its children representing particular parameter signatures of the given function.
    </li>
    <li>Deprecated functions are shown as <i>disabled</i> (in grey color).</li>
    <li>
    As it was early, there are actually two function trees:
    <ol>
      <li>
       <i>"Functions by Category"</i>, which represents all functions within a predefined category tree
       according to their general functionality. (The same function may actually appear in different categories).

      <li>
       <i>"All Functions"</i>, which provides a single list of all available functions ordered alphabetically.

    For instance, under WordPad, certain features of the old RTF output might be distorted,
    or the whole doc might get invisible starting from some point.

  <b>Renaming of the full edition</b>
  <p>
  The full edition of DocFlex/XML software, which was formerly called "DocFlex/XML SDK", is renamed back
  to "DocFlex/XML (Full Edition)" to reflect the fact that a "DocFlex/XML SDK" license does not cover

    <b><i>Text Control</i></b>
    <p>
    The "Label Control" has been renamed into "Text Control" and more functionality added.
    <p>
    The purpose of Text Control is to specify some static text in templates.
    Now, unlike the old Label Control, it shows the full multi-line text directly in the designer pane 
    (with the support of scrolling). This may be particular helpful, when you want to specify in templates
    some multi-line descriptions.
    <p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="v1.8.5_grouping_elements"></a>
    <b><i>Grouping of elements with Element Iterators</i></b>
    <p>
    A new property has been introduced for Element Iterators: <b><i>"Expression for Grouping Key"</i></b>
    (found on the <i>"Processing | Sorting/Grouping | Grouping"</i> tab of the Element Iterator properties dialog
    in the Template Designer).
    It allows you to break the iterated elements into groups so as to iterate, first, by the groups
    and, then, by the elements within each group.
    <p>
    It works as follows.
    <p>
    After the initial elements have been collected, filtered and sorted, the result sequence of elements
    is broken into groups according to the grouping keys generated for each element by the FlexQuery 
    specified in the <i>"Expression for Grouping Key"</i> of the Element Iterator.
    <p>
    Each continuous subsequence of elements with equal grouping keys produces a group.
    As a result, the sequence of elements prepared for iterations is converted into a sequence of element groups.
    The ordering of elements in each group remains the same as in the initial sequence.
    <p>
    Since groups are not elements, the Element Iterator cannot iterate by them directly.
    So, it will iterate by the first elements taken from each group. 
    However, at that, on each iteration step, the Generator Object Model (GOM) property 
    <code>iterator.groupElements</code>, which is accessible in FlexQuery expressions,
    is updated so as to provide the enumeration of all elements
    in the given group.
    This allows you to specify a nested Element Iterator that will iterate by the elements
    in the group received from the <code>iterator.groupElements</code> property.

    <b><i>Adding JavaScript in generated HTML</i></b>
    <p>
    Although, dynamic HTML is not currently in the focus of DocFlex templates,
    the following setting has been supported:
    <i>Template | Properties | Output File | <b>HTML Head Expression</b></i>.
    <p>
    It specifies an expression that may produce a string, which will be included in the header
    (between &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt; tags) of an HTML file generated by the given template.
    In particular, this allows you to embed in the generated HTML file any custom JavaScript code 
    (enclosed in &lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt; tags).
    <p>
    For instance, this may be used to reload the <code>'detail'</code> frame
    (of a frameset defined in <code>index.html</code>) with another HTML document passed 
    to <code>index.html</code> via a URL parameter (specified after '?' in the initial URL).

    <b><i>Definition of hyperlinks</i></b>
    <p>
    Hyperlinks are generated according to special link/target definitions specified in template components
    (see component's Properties Dialog | Hypertext tab).
    Now, hyperlink definitions themselves look more like components.
    The following settings/features have been added:
    <ul>
    <li><i>Description</i>
      <p>
      Some hyperlink definitions may be so complicated that they are better to be explained.
      <p>
    </li>
    <li><i>Expression for New Context Element</i>
      <p>
      The same as in template components, it allows switching context element used for calculations of other
      hyperlink's settings.
      <p>
    </li>
    <li><i>Matching Element Type(s)</i>
      <p>
      Specify one or several element types, which the context element must match.
      This is a kind of filter. If the context element does not match any of the specified types,
      the whole hyperlink definition will be skipped.
      <p>
    </li>
    <li><i>Matrix of alternative keys</i>
      <p>
      A hyperlink is created when the vector of keys generated by the <i>Link Key Expressions</i>
      matches a similar vector of keys associated with a certain target (generated by a different component).
      <p>
      Now, in addition to single vector of keys, it is possible to define matrix of alternative keys.
      The matrix columns become alternative key vectors. If one vector cannot be matched, another is tried.
      <p>
      This allows unifying in a single hyperlink definition what were previously several ones,
      which simplifies programming and improves performance of the template.

    <b><i>Output directory for Image Control</i></b>
    <p>
    Image Control has been extended with a new property: <b><i>"Expression for Image File Output Directory"</i></b>,
    which allows programming where the images produced by a given Image Control will be stored.
    In particular, this makes possible to save all standard documentation icons in a single directory
    (and, therefore, to prevent duplicating them):
    <blockquote>
      <code><i>{doc-root}</i>/resources</code>
    </blockquote>

    given document (which is now also the case when no separate image output directory specified).
    <p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="v1.8.5_return_statement"></a>
    <b><i>'Return' statement in FlexQuery expressions</i></b>
    <p>
    FlexQuery expressions are small program blocks (called <i>queries</i>) with a Java-like syntax
    that are used in templates to calculate dynamic properties of template components and for other needs.
    <p>
    Now, the FlexQuery language is extended with the <i>return</i> statement:
    <blockquote>
      <code>return <i>&lt;result_expr&gt;</i></code>
    </blockquote>
    It makes possible to stop the execution of the query at any point and return the query result,
    which is calculated by the <i><code>result_expr</code></i> specified in the return statement.
    <p>
    The type of the returned result is checked to comply with the data type necessary for the given query.
    This is done yet during the parsing of the query (e.g. in Template Designer).
    <p>
    A FlexQuery expression may also contain subqueries, which are nested code blocks executed not directly,
    but rather passed as parameters to functions. A function may call such a subquery repeatedly
    to calculate certain things (e.g. to check a filter condition for the elements processed by the function).
    <p>
    A subquery may also contain <i>return</i> statements, which will affect only the execution of that subquery.
    The <i><code>result_expr</code></i> specified in such a return statement will be also checked, however, 
    now only to comply with the data type necessary for the given subquery.

  </li>
  <li><a name="v1.8.5_flattening_ehtml"></a>
    <b><i>Flattening of embedded HTML</i></b>
    <p>
    <i>Embedded HTML</i> is the HTML markup (tags) inserted by the user directly in various descriptions, annotations etc.
    (stored as plain text in XML files) in order to format them.
    To have that formatting show up in the generated documentation, in general, the embedded HTML markup needs
    to be processed (rendered) specifically, which depends on the output format. This is controlled by
    the <i>"Render embedded HTML"</i> option of the given output format.
    <p>
    Sometimes it is needed to remove all block-level HTML tags but leave any other tags, so that
    the result text would be displayed formatted but without any structure, as a single line.
    That, we call <i>flattening</i>.
    <p>
    It is supported now!
    <p>
    A new formatting property has been introduced for all template components: 
    <b><i>"Embedded HTML | Flatten"</i></b>
    (found on the <i>"Formatting | Text Flow"</i> tab of the component properties dialog in the Template Designer).
    If it is selected, any embedded HTML markup found in the text output produced by the component will be flattened
    (given that the embedded HTML is processed both as a whole and for that component in particular).
    This will also affect all nested components (including called stock-sections), unless rendering 
    of embedded HTML is specifically disabled in some of them.
  </li>
  <li><a name="v1.8.5_template_descriptions"></a>
    <b><i>Separation of template/parameter descriptions from templates</i></b>
    <p>
    Before this version, all descriptions of templates and their parameters could be stored only directly 
    within the templates themselves.
    Now, they can be held also in separate text files located near the main templates.
    (The description text may also include HTML markup.)
    <p>
    This makes possible:
    <ul>
      <li>To reuse the same descriptions in several main templates</li>
      <li>To reduce the sizes of main templates considerably thereby making them loadable faster</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    That functionality is achieved by introducing of a new macro:
    <blockquote>
      <code>${include <i>&lt;url&gt;</i>}</code>
    </blockquote>
    Such macros can be inserted both within the descriptions stored directly in templates
    and within the included text files themselves.
    <p>
    The <i><code>url</code></i> specified in the macro points to the file to be included.
    The macro is expanded with the content of that file (after the expansion of any <i>include</i>
    macros found in that file).
    <p>
    The file URL may be both absolute and relative one.
    If the macro is found within a description stored in a template, the relative URL
    is interpreted against the location of that template. If the macro is found within a text file,
    the URL is interpreted against the location of that file.

    Now, in the Parameter Inspector, those parameters that are irrelevant to the current settings
    (specified in other parameters) can be shown disabled. This will help navigating the parameter tree.
    <p>
    That is achieved by introducing new properties in the template parameter definition:
    <i>"Enabling Condition"</i> and <i>"Group | Enabling Condition"</i>.
    They specify the boolean FlexQuery expressions (queries) that are evaluated each time
    any of the template parameters is changed:
    <ul>
    <li>
      When the <i>"Enabling Condition"</i> query returns false, the given parameter is disabled.
    </li>
    <li>
      When <i>"Group | Enabling Condition"</i> query returns false, all parameters in the group
      headed by the given parameter are disabled.

  <li><a name="v1.8.5_procedure_templates"></a>
    <b><i>Procedure Templates</i></b>
    <p>
    <i>Procedure templates</i> are a special kind of templates that generate no output.
    Rather, they have been used internally in big template applications to employ the data querying and processing
    capabilities of template components (such as Element Iterator) for some auxiliary tasks 
    (e.g. creating of element maps).
    <p>
    Now, the role of procedure templates has been extended, so they can be used also 
    to generate multi-file documentation with no particular root.
    The following functionality has been supported:
    <ul>
    <li>
      A procedure template can be specified directly to the generator, that is, used as a <i>main template</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Procedure templates can call from themselves other templates, including document and frameset templates,
      which would generate separate documentation files.
    </li>
    <li>
      A procedure template may include definitions of any number of parameters (with any complexity) 
      to control a large template application, as well as all the formatting styles to be inherited
      by the called subtemplates.

  <li><a name="v1.8.5_default_xml_catalog"></a>
    <b><i>Default XML catalog</i></b>
    <p>
    A <i>default XML catalog</i> has been introduced. Its purpose is to point to the local copies
    of some standard XML schemas found in Internet
    (like <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.xsd" class="nowrap">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.xsd</a>),
    which are critical for <a href="doc/index.html?docflex-xml/xsddoc/overview.html">XSDDoc</a> templates.
    <p>
    Previously, those schemas were held along with the XSDDoc templates in the directory:
    <blockquote>
      <code><i>{docflex-xml}</i>/templates/XSDDoc/xmltype/</code>
    </blockquote>
    Now, they have been moved to a more central location in the DocFlex/XML resource directory:
    <blockquote>
      <code><i>{docflex-xml}</i>/lib/resources/</code>
    </blockquote>
    so as to allow reusing them for other things (e.g. in the coming WSDLDoc template set).
    <p>
    The default XML catalog, which is located in the same directory in the file:
    <blockquote>
      <code><i>{docflex-xml}</i>/lib/resources/catalog.xml</code>
    </blockquote>
    allows referencing to those schemas by their standard internet URLs, yet loading them from

    <b><i>Generation of CSS file</i></b>
    <p>
    All internal CSS declarations, which were previously defined and used only locally in every generated HTML document,
    now can be held in a single <code>'stylesheet.css'</code> file stored in the documentation root.
    Only links to this file will be included in the generated HTML documents.
    <p>
    Although such CSS declarations look typlically rather gibberish, they tend to repeat across HTML files.
    So, moving them to a single CSS file may substantially reduce the overall size of the generated HTML documentation.
    <p>
    That possibility is controlled by a new 
    <i>"<a href="#v1.8.5_html_options_generateCSSFile">Output | Generate style sheet file</a>"</i> option.
    <p>
    What's more, using the nested <i>"<a href="#v1.8.5_html_options_cssPatternFile">CSS pattern file</a>"</i> option,
    you can frame the generated CSS declarations into your own CSS file. That will allow you to include in the

    <p>
    Before this version, all formatting styles defined across a template set,
    which are not overridden by other equally named styles from parent (calling) templates,
    would produce the same number of separate styles in the RTF.
    <p>
    Now, this is changed:
    <ul>
      <li>
        An RTF style is generated only when it is actually used (that is, there are references to it).

      </li>
      <li>
        All equally named styles (defined in a template set), whose all properties are equal
        and which are not overridden by other styles from calling templates,
        will produce the only style in RTF (with those name and properties).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    That optimization prevents the contamination of the generated RTF with many unused styles
    (which have been defined in templates but never used) and duplicated styles
    (which are defined in several subtemplates, but never in the main one).

    <b><i>Size and scaling of EMF Images</i></b>
    <p>
    Specification of the size and scaling of EMF images in RTF has been completely reworked.
    <p>
    As it was implemented previously, some EMF images inserted by DocFlex in RTF were scaled
    incorrectly by MS Word, which resulted in displaying of too small or too large images
    (particularly, when the goal was just to make an image/diagram fit best in the available page size).
    Now, it is fixed (see below)!
    <p>
    EMF is a vector graphic format, which is especially useful for various diagrams.
    It is widely generated by many software systems (thanks to its direct support by MS Windows itself, via its APIs).

    <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr><td class="note">
      It took great efforts to understand how MS Word interprets (and calculates by itself)
      the size of an EMF image specified in RTF.
      <p></p>
      When an EMF image just has been inserted in the document, MS Word 2000 displays it
      on the document sheet exactly according to the pixel size of the image specified in the EMF file.
      <p></p>
      But other lengths are interpreted by MS Word not quite the same as they are.
      For instance, when you specify a page width in points, MS Word converts it into the pixel width
      it displays according to the formula:
      <blockquote>
        <code>width<sub> pt</sub> * 5/3</code>
      </blockquote>
      The same <code>5/3</code> factor is used by MS Word 2000 to display PNG and GIF images.
      Their pixel size visible in MS Word is calculated as follows:
      <blockquote><code>
        image size<sub> pt</sub> = image size<sub> pix, from image file</sub> / 96<sub> screen dpi</sub> * 72<sub> points per inch</sub><br>
        image size<sub> pix, in MS Word 2000</sub> = image size<sub> pt</sub> * 5/3
      </code></blockquote>
      In RTF, the image size must be specified in 0.01 mm. MS Word uses that size to display
      the image as well as scale it according to <code>\picscalex</code> & <code>\picscaley</code> commands specified in RTF.
      <p></p>
      So, to be stored in RTF, the original EMF image size in pixels must be converted first
      into some non-pixel units -- e.g. points, which can be converted further to mm according to standard
      formula -- that will be interpreted correctly by MS Word.
      (In fact, EMF file does include the image size specified in 0.01 mm, but it cannot be used here
      because MS Word 2000 completely ignores it.)
      <p></p>
      From the investigation above, we've got an idea. The point size of an EMF image (to be used
      for RTF) should be calculated like this:
      <blockquote>
         <code>image size<sub> pix, from EMF file</sub> * 3/5</code>
      </blockquote>
      That turned out to work perfect!
      When an EMF image is specified in RTF with such a size,
      both MS Word 2000 and MS Word 2010 display and scale it correctly.

    <b><i>Element Images</i></b>
    <p>
    The DocFlex/XML core (namely, XML <a href="doc/index.html?general/about.html#dsm">DSM</a>
    [Data Source Model] driver)
    has been extended with an abstract functionality that allows dynamic association
    of some XML elements with certain graphic representations of them called <i>element images</i>
    (which are typically some diagrams). Such images may be also supplied with hypertext <i>imagemaps</i>,
    which enable generation of hyperlinks from the specific image regions to the corresponding locations
    in the documentation.
    <p>
    The element images (and imagemaps to them) are not generated by the XML
    <a href="doc/index.html?general/about.html#dsm">DSM</a> driver itself. Rather the driver
    exposes a special <i>Element Image Provider</i> interface, which may be implemented by another extension
    (or integration) specific to a particular template application field.
    Such an implementation should "understand" the semantics of the underlying XML data source and
    generate diagrams/images (along with the imagemaps) that somehow depict particular XML elements.
    <p>
    When supported, element images are accessible in templates via
    <a href="doc/index.html?general/template_components.html#image_control">Image Controls</a>,
    which makes possible to program how those images are inserted in the generated output, formatted and
    hyperlinked to other documentation parts.
    <p>
    The new Element Image functionality was immediately used to develop the
    <a href="doc/index.html?docflex-xml/integrations/XMLSpy.html">XMLSpy Integration</a>
    (see <a href="#v1.8.0_XMLSpy_integration">below</a>).

  </li>
  <li><a name="v1.8.0_section_flow_control"></a>
    <b><i>Section Flow Control</i></b>
    <p>
    A new property has been introduced for template sections: <b><i>"Output Notification Expression"</i></b>
    (found on the <i>"Component | Options"</i> tab of the section property dialog in the Template Designer).
    <p>
    When that expression is specified, it will be executed each time the section has produced a non-empty output
    (on the finishing of the section processing).
    <p>
    This makes possible, for instance, to program such things like tracking whether particular output sections 
    have been generated early and, depending on it, to add some kind of separator (e.g. horizontal rule)
    before the output that follows them.
    <p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="v1.8.0_service_attributes"></a>
    <b><i>Service Attributes</i></b>
    <p>
    A new functionality has been supported that makes possible to dynamically attach any data to particular
    <a href="doc/index.html?general/about.html#dsm_element">DSM elements</a>
    using special <i>service attributes</i>.
    <p>
    Service attributes serve the same role as normal element attributes.
    They allow you to attach specific data to particular DSM elements and access those data by names.
    However, unlike normal 
    <a href="doc/index.html?general/about.html#dsm_attribute">DSM attributes</a>,
    service attributes are not provided by the DSM driver and not connected to the external data source.
    Rather, they are maintained by the generator itself in the form of a special hash-map.
    <p>
    <table><tr><td class="note">
      That hash-map is actually very simple. Each service attribute is represented by a two-part key:
      { attrName; element.id }, where 'attrName' is the attribute name;
      'element.id' is the unique identifier of the DSM element, to which the attribute is attached.
      Such a key is mapped to the attribute value.
    </td></tr></table>
    </p>
    The main purpose of service attributes is to use them as a data cache.
    That is to store some frequently needed information about particular elements,
    which although can be found in the <a href="doc/index.html?general/about.html#dsm">DSM</a>,
    practically is difficult to collect.
    <p>
    To work with service attributes, the following FlexQuery functions have been added:
    <p>
    <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" border="1">
      <tr bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
        <th>Function</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>setServiceAttr()</code></td>
        <td>Assigns a service attribute with the specified name and value to the specified element.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>getServiceAttr()</code></td>
        <td>Returns the value of a service attribute with the specified name attached to the specified element.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>hasServiceAttr()</code></td>
        <td>Tests if there is a service attribute with the specified name attached to the specified element.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>removeServiceAttr()</code></td>
        <td>Deletes a service attribute with the specified name attached to the specified element.</td>
      </tr>

    The HTML output generator was optimized to work about 5% faster

    Besides this, the following HTML options have been added:
    <p>
    <i>"Use fixed font sizes"</i>
    <blockquote>
      If selected (true), all font sizes will be fixed. The actual font sizes are calculated
      from the values specified in templates adjusted against the base font size specified in 
      the <i>"Base font size"</i> option.
      <p>
      This option is not exactly new. It replaces the previous <i>"Use relative font sizes"</i> option,
      which had the opposite meaning.
    </blockquote>

    <i>"Base font size"</i>
    <blockquote>
      This option is used only together with the <i>"Use fixed font sizes"</i> option (when checked).
      It specifies the base font size (in points) against which the actual fixed font sizes used 
      in the generated HTML are calculated.

    <p>
    <i>"Hypertext | Generate hyperlinks"</i>
    <blockquote>
      Specify whether to add hyperlinks in the RTF output.
      <p>
      Note: To have cross-reference hyperlinks (those pointing within the same document) be generated, 
      the <i>"Generate bookmarks"</i> option must also be selected. Without it, only external (URL)
      hyperlinks will be possible.
    </blockquote>

    <i>"Hypertext | Generate bookmarks"</i>
    <blockquote>
      Specify whether to add bookmarks in the RTF output.
      <p>
      Bookmarks are needed to generated both cross-reference hyperlinks and page number references.
    </blockquote>

    <i>"Hypertext | Bookmark name prefix"</i>
    <blockquote>
      Specify prefix for automatically generated bookmark names.
      <p>
      This option may be useful when you need to merge several RTF files produced with DocFlex 
      into a single document. In that case, you should generate those files with different bookmark prefixes.
      This will ensure that the bookmarks from different RTFs never overlap and all hyperlinks and 
      page number references in the result document are correct.
    </blockquote>

    One more option was added specifically to format large images:
    <p>
    <i>"Images | Allow image rotation"</i>
    <blockquote>
      Allows rotating big images to make them better fit in the specified paper size 
      in order to minimize the image scaling. Currently, this is supported only for the element images 
      (diagrams) generated in PNG or GIF format and only when all graphics is stored in the RTF file.

    the <a href="doc/index.html?docflex-xml/docs/generator.html#gui">generator dialog</a>

    <b><i>Extraction of first sentence from HTML formatted text</i></b>
    <p>
    First sentences of description texts are used in various summary tables.
    In a plain text, the first sentence is defined by the position of the dot (<code>'.'</code>) 
    that ends the sentence.
    When a text is formatted with HTML, extracting its first sentence becomes trickier.
    In that case, besides the dot, a sentence may be terminated with a block-level tag.
    In the early implementation,
    all such tags were taken into account. Now, all heading tags (like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) are ignored.
    So, when a text has a heading, it will be just added before the first sentence extracted from the actual text,
    but not replace it. This will make those short descriptions placed in summary table be more informative.

    A new property has been introduced for template sections: <b><i>"Break Parent Section Block"</i></b>.
    <p>
    When specified, it forces the template interpreter, after the processing of the given section,
    to break the further processing of the containing it section block according to the property value,
    which may be one of the following:
    <p>
    <i>"break when section executed"</i>
    <blockquote>
      The processing of the parent block will be broken only when the given section has been executed.
      <p>

    In the Template Designer, when the <i>'Break Parent Section Block'</i> property is specified
    on a section, it is indicated with a special icon, which appears on that section in the left designer
    pane (showing the section tree).
    The property itself can be specified in the <i>"Component | Options"</i> tab of section's property dialog.
    <p>
    Until now, the functionality of the new property was substituted by testing 
    in the enabling conditions of other sections (located below the given one) one of the generator variables:
    <code>'sectionBlock.execSecNone'</code> or <code>'sectionBlock.outputSecNone'</code>.
    (Those variables allow you to test if some sections in a section block have been already executed
    or produced a non-empty output.)
    <p>
    The old approach works as well now. However, the new one adds clarity, simplifies programming and 
    may substantially improve performance of template applications.
    <p>
    In particular, the new feature allowed us to boost about 15% the performance of the 
    "<a href="templates/XSDDoc/README.html">XSDDoc</a>" template application!

    <b><i>Multivalued (List) Parameters</i></b>
    <p>
    Since this version, DocFlex/XML supports multi-valued template parameters
    (called also <i>list</i> parameters, for short).
    </p><p>
    Such parameters allow you to pass into template the whole vector of different values 
    associated with the same parameter name. This provides a universal mechanism for implementing 
    a user control over how a set of templates processes a certain type of data (or situations) 
    that may come in unlimited number of variations.
    A list parameter can be specified both in the Parameter Inspector dialog of the Generator GUI
    and on the generator command line (using one or many <code>-P</code> options).

    <b><i>Very long nonbreaking strings in RTF</i></b>
    <p>
    The automatic wrapping of very long nonbreaking strings within table cells has been improved.
    <p>
    Until this version, such a wrapping was done correctly when the string was generated by the same control.
    When the entire nonbreaking string was produced by different controls (possibly using different fonts),
    it was not recognized as a single string and, therefore, was not broken as needed.
    That caused some summary tables in RTF JavaDoc to expand beyond the page width.
    <p>
    Now, this is fixed!
    <p>

  <a href="http://www.filigris.com/licensing/#multiple_licenses">multiple licenses</a>

  a possibility to attach licenses to particular sets of templates 
  (<a href="http://www.filigris.com/licensing/#templates.cta">commercial template application</a>).
  <p>

  <b>Generator GUI | Template Parameter Inspector</b>
  <p>
  As the number of template parameters (controlling what is generated) ever grows,
  the Template Parameter Inspector in its previous form became increasingly cumbersome and difficult to navigate. 
  <p>
  This problem has been addressed by introducing a possibility to collapse/expand the parameter group nodes dynamically 
  (some of which can be preset in the templates to appear initially in the collapsed form; 
  further, the current collapse/expand state of particular group nodes is saved in the 
  <code>generator.config</code> and restored next time). 
  <p>
  What is more, now some of the parameter group nodes may themselves serve as the template parameters.
  <p>
  These improvements allow introducing lots of parameters so as to control a particular big template application.
  Those parameters may be organized in the form of a hierarchical tree, which is both compact and easy to navigate.

      This feature may not sound very great, but it was not that easy to implement.
      In fact, it substantially speeds up the process of designing of templates
      (which we particularly need ourselves as the primary users of our own tool).

      The definitions of XML Types (which provide datatype information about XML-file data sources)
      have been moved from a single location (previously, in <code>config/xmltypes.config</code> file)
      to any number of XML Type Configuration Files.
      Now, a complete XML Type definition (which includes the XML schemas describing the particular 
      XML data source) can be stored together with the template set based on it and loaded dynamically when needed.
      This makes possible to represent a particular template application in the form of a single software unit 
      that can be easily distributed and deployed by its own.
      <p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><a name="v1.6.8_template_designer"></a>
  <b>Template Designer</b>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The "New Template" dialog in the template designer has been reworked completely 
      in order to make it easier to select the necessary XML Type (on which the new template 
      is to be based). Now, when absent in the list, the needed XML Type can also be loaded
      interactively from an XML Type config file containing its definition.
      <p>
    </li>
    <li>
      When Copy/Paste template components, the original settings of the component being copied 
      (including those of its nested components) that are dependant on the context 
      (e.g. the context Element Type or formatting styles) are preserved now in some "latent" form 
      along with the copy of that component at the new location. This is done even though those 
      settings might be senseless according to the new context at the moment of copying.
      (For instance, the original component may print the value of an attribute of the context element.
      However, at the new location the current context Element Type has no such an attribute.
      Hence, the component's settings about that attribute would be lost. The same is true 
      about formatting styles.) Once at the new location the context has been changed 
      appropriately (e.g. the needed formatting style has been copied there as well), 
      the latent settings will be restored as actual ones. This all may save lots of time 
      when a piece of a template is being reused at different locations or in another template 
      (perhaps with some little changes).
      All the necessary context settings simply cannot be copied to the new location together with 
      the component at once!
      <p>
    </li>
    <li>
      In the Element Type Tree, which shows the data type information about the particular
      XML-file data source (see <i>Template Designer | Help | Assistant | All Element Types</i>),
      the child element types and attributes inherited from the ancestor types appear now 
      in a different color. This helps to distinguish them quickly from the own children 
      and attribute of the given type, which adds clarity to the whole representation.

      <p>
      Now, when generating HTML, the DocFlex generator itself converts point size into pixel size according 
      to the DPI value specified in the formatting properties of the given templates
      (see: <i>Template Designer | File | Properties | Formatting | General | Resolution (DPI)</i>).

  had been already available for more than a year before that.)
  <p>
  Most of the document formatting capabilities was already in place. 
  All processing of XML files was already based on the data type information obtained from DTD or XML Schemas.
  However, the actual data sources possible to process at once with a single template were limited to only
  one XML file.
