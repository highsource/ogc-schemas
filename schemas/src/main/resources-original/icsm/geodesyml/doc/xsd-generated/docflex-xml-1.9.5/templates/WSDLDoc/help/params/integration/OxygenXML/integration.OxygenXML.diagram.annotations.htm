Specify whether the component annotations should be shown on the diagrams.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> All other things displayed on diagrams cannot be controlled via parameters.
But you can adjust that in the Oxygen XML Editor itself.
In its main menu select: <i>Options | Preferences</i>. Then, in Preferences dialog
that appears select: <i>Editor | Edit Modes | Schema Design | Properties</i>.
On the right panel for that item, 
you can specify lots of other things to be shown on diagrams.
Those settings will equally work with the diagrams generated via OxygenXML Integration.
