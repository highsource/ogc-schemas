Specifies whether to remove all <b><code>&lt;xs:annotation&gt;</code></b> elements
from the reproduced WSDL file source.
<p>
<code>&lt;xs:annotation&gt;</code> elements may be found in the XML schemas embedded in the WSDL file.
You may want to exclude them from the reproduced XML source
because such elements may occupy a lot of space (especially, when you use XHTML to format your annotations),
so they could overwhelm anything else making it difficult to read other important things.
Moreover, the actual content of the <code>&lt;xs:annotation&gt;</code> elements may be already shown
(as a formatted text) in the corresponding <i>Annotation</i> sections of the documentation.
