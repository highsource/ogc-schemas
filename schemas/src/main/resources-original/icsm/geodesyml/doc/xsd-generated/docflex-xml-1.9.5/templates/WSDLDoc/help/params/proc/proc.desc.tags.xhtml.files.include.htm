Specify the list of XML schemas whose annotations may contain XHTML markup.
<p>
Each XML schema is specified with its file name (the last name in the pathname's name sequence, e.g. "xml.xsd").
Multiple file names should be separated with the allowed item separator (e.g. newline).
<p>
When this parameter is assigned (with a non-empty string specifying the schema list),
the XHTML tags will be processed in annotations of only those schemas whose file names are found in that list.
