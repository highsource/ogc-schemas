Specify whether to document the additional XML schema files loaded by
<b><code>&lt;xs:import&gt;</code></b> elements.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> When an XML schema is both specified initially on the command line
and referenced from an <code>&lt;xs:import&gt;</code> element, it is loaded only 
once as the <i>initial</i> schema, however, it will be marked as
the <i>imported</i> schema as well.
