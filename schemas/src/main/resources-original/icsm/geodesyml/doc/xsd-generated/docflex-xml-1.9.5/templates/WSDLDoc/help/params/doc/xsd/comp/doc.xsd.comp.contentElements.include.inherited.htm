Specify whether to document in this section the declarations of content elements <b>inherited</b>
from other (ancestor) components. 
<p>
When this parameter is selected (<b><code>true</code></b>), both the elements declared directly within
this component itself and those inherited from other (ancestor) components will be documented together.
That will result in repeating of the details of the same content element declarations across the documentation
of all components that inherit those content elements.
<p>
If this parameter is unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>), only content elements specified directly
within the declaration of this component will be documented. Any content elements inherited
from other components will be documented only once along with their parent components (where they are declared).
Only hyperlinks to the corresponding content element details will lead from this component documentation
(e.g. from the <i>XML Representation Summary</i>). That setting will produce a more compact documentation.
