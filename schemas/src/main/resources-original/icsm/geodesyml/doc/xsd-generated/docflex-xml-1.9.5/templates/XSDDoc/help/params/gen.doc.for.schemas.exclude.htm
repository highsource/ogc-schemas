Using this parameter, you can filter out some schemas from those initially selected
with the parameters above.
<p>
Each excluded XML schema should be specified with its file name 
(the last name in the pathname's name sequence, e.g. "xml.xsd").
Multiple file names are separated with the allowed item separator (e.g. newline).
<p>
<b>Note:</b> 
This parameter overrides the <i>"Include"</i> parameter (above).
That is, when a schema file is specified in both <i>"Include"</i> and <i>"Exclude"</i>
parameters, it will be excluded from the documentation scope.
