When a hyperlink appears on a schema component name,
it would be helpful to use the link tooltip to quickly
see what a namespace this component belongs to.

<p style="margin:0">
<table border="1">
<tr><td><font face="Dialog" size="-1">
This might be particularly useful when the XML schemas you document
define many components with equal local names, however, in different namespaces
and no prefixes are defined for those namespaces at that.
</font>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This parameter allows you to generate such tooltips. When it is selected
(<b><code>true</code></b>), the titles of hyperlinks leading from component names
will include the namespace URI of those components, 
as shown on the following screenshot:

<dl><dd>
  <img src="${this_dir}/../images/link_tooltip2.png">
</dd></dl>

But note that since the namespace URIs are typically rather long strings,
when added to each hyperlink, they may considerably blow out the generated HTML files.
That's why this parameter was introduced: to be able to switch them off.
