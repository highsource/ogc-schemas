Specify whether to document in this section the declarations of attributes <b>inherited</b> from other (ancestor) components. 
<p>
When this parameter is selected (<b><code>true</code></b>), both the attributes declared directly within
this component itself and those inherited from its ancestor components will be documented together.
That will result in repeating of the details of the same attribute declarations across the documentation of all 
components that inherit those attributes.
<p>
If this parameter is unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>), only attributes specified directly within the declaration
of this component will be documented. Any attributes inherited from other components will be documented
only once along with their parent components (where they are declared).
Only hyperlinks to the corresponding attribute details will lead from this component documentation
(e.g. from the <i>XML Representation Summary</i>).
That setting will produce a more compact documentation.
