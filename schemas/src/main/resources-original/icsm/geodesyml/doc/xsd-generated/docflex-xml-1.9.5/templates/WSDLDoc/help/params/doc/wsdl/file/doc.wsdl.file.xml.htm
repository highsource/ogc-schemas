Specifies whether to reproduce the XML source of the whole WSDL file.
<p>
It appears as a part of the documentation
with the XML markup highlighted with special colors and the values of some XML attributes
hyperlinked to the related sections of the documentation.
<p>
The reproduced XML source is included as a section of the <i>WSDL File Overview</i> page/block.
In case of framed HTML documentation, it may be also placed in a separate page (HTML file),
which is controlled by the nested parameter: <i>"Separate File"</i>.

Although the reproduced XML source closely replicates the real one, it may be slightly different.
For instance, ordering of XML attribute may be not the same. 
Additionally, <code>&lt;wsdl:documentation&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;xs:annotation&gt;</code> elements
may be intentionally omitted, which is controlled by the nested parameters:
<ul>
<li><i>"Remove &lt;wsdl:documentation&gt;"</i></li>
<li><i>"Remove &lt;xs:annotation&gt;"</i></li>
</ul>
