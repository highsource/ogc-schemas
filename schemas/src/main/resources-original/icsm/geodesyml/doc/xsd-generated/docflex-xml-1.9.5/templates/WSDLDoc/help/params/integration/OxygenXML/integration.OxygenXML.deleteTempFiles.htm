Specify whether to delete all files temporarily generated by OxygenXML
(as well as the integration files required for it).
<p>
When this parameter is selected (<b><code>true</code></b>),
the entire subdirectory:
<dl><dd>
<code>{documentation_files}/OxygenXML</code>
</dd></dl>
will be deleted on the finishing of WSDLDoc.
<p>
When this parameter is unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>),
all original output files generated by OxygenXML will be left.
(Typically, this is needed to investigate some problems about the integration.)
