Specify whether to correct <b>imagemap coordinates</b> generated by XMLSpy.
<p>
As of the versions XMLSpy 2004-2011, all rectangle areas contained in the hypertext imagemaps
associated with the content model diagrams generated by XMLSpy are shifted slightly to the top and left,
which makes every clickable area to appear somewhat displaced from where it should be.
<p>
We have found no rational purpose behind this and assumed that it was simply a bug.
Therefore, we programmed a correction by adding <code>(+10,+5)</code> to every <code>(x,y)</code>
coordinate found in the imagemaps.
<p>
Now, this works fine. But since it is likely a bug in XMLSpy, they may fix it some time later.
In that case, our correction would actually produce a distortion by itself.
<p>
With this parameter, you can disable any corrections.
Unselect it (or specify <b><code>false</code></b>) to have only the original imagemap coordinates
(generated by XMLSpy) used in the result documentation.
