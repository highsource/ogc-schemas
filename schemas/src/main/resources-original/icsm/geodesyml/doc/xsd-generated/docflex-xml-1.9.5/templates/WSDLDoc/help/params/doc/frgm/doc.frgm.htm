This parameter group allows you to control at once the appearance of similar fragments
found in different main documentation blocks. This includes:
<ul>
<li>WSDL File Summary</li>
<li>Schema Summary</li>
<li>WSDL Definition Summary</li>
<li>XSD component Summary</li>
</ul>
Actually, those particular fragments are controlled by their own parameters.
But the parameters in this group provide the default values to them.
Thereby, you don't need to repeat the same type of settings across all related parameters
in the whole parameter tree.
