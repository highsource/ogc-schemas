With these parameters you can filter which WSDL files and XML schemas should be documented in full details.
<p>
Precisely, <b><i>WSDL file</i></b> is considered any XML file containing
<code>&lt;wsdl:definitions&gt;</code> as top element.
<b><i>XML schemas</i></b> is identified by a <code>&lt;xs:schema&gt;</code> element
found either as top XML file element or within <code>&lt;wsdl:definitions&gt;/&lt;wsdl:types&gt;</code> element
(in that case, it is called <b><i>embedded schema</i></b>).
Those things come from the following locations:
<ul>
<li>WSDL/XSD files specified initially as the generator arguments.</li>
<li>WSDL/XSD files directly or indirectly referenced from the initial files (via
<code>&lt;wsdl:import&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;xs:import&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;xs:include&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;xs:redefine&gt;</code> elements).</li>
</ul>
Although all involved WSDL files and XML schemas must be loaded and processed,
you may want actually to document only some of them.
With these parameters you can specify which.
<p>
<b>Note:</b>
The filtered out WSDL files and XML schemas (as well as the definitions/components found in them)
may still be mentioned in the documentation, however with few details.
