  <a name="trial_license"></a>
  3. Trial License
</h2>

The Trial License is provided for those Software products that are available for 
<a href="#commercial_license">Commercial Licensing</a>.
<p>
The Trial License grants Licensee the non-exclusive and non-transferable right
to install and run the Software for free during 15 days (or 30 days) for evaluation purposes only.

However, that possibility may be limited.

<h3>
  <a name="trial_license.output"></a>
  3.1. Generated Output
</h3>

The output files generated under the <a href="#trial_license">Trial License</a>
may be used <b>for evaluation purposes only</b>.
The Licensee is strictly prohibited to use the generated documentation (or any parts of it) for any job tasks!
<p>
To enforce this condition, all output documents generated (in HTML and RTF formats) under the
<a href="#trial_license">Trial License</a> will be heavily <b>distorted</b> by replacing some letters
with bullet ('&#8226;') characters (as well as contain special messages).
<p>
Under the full <a href="#commercial_single_user_license">commercial license</a>, 
no text distortion and trial messages will appear!

  <a name="trial_license.templates"></a>
  3.2. Templates
</h3>

Any templates created/modified under the <a href="#trial_license">Trial License</a>
may be used for evaluation purposes only.
<p>
The Licensee may not distribute those templates to anyone else (e.g. to someone who already has a 
<a href="#commercial_single_user_license">commercial license</a>)
and in that way to circumvent buying the full license.
<p>
The templates created/modified under the <a href="#trial_license">Trial License</a> will not work
with any of the reduced editions of the given product line.
<p>
The <a href="#trial_license">Trial License</a> allows the Licensee to execute any custom templates

<h2>
  <a name="commercial_license"></a>
  4. Commercial License
</h2>

Under this term, the Software is licensed to a specific individual person or legal entity.
<p>
The Software is priced on a per-user basis and any license specifies the authorized number of users,
the licensee name, organization and e-mail address.
<p>
Each Commercial License is a <b>floating</b> license.
It means that the license may be installed on any number of computers and used by any number of people,
provided that the number of concurrent users never exceeds the number of licensed users.
<p>
Since DocFlex Software currently provides no specific license manager or activation procedure
that checks the number of concurrent users,
it is the responsibility of the Licensee to ensure and check that the number of actual users never
exceeds the authorized number.
If the Licensee cannot control this, the sufficient number of licenses must be acquired.
<p>
The Commercial License permits using it only by the members of the Licensee
company/organization as a single legal entity.
If the Licensee is a private person, only this person may use the license.
<p>
The Commercial License may not be transferred to any other company/organization
or individual, except the direct successor of the Licensee, who takes over the full legal rights and
responsibility over the licensee business.
<p>
The Licensee is not allowed
<ul>
<li>
  To redistribute the Software (or any part of it), either as a whole or as a part of any other application. 
</li>
<li>
  To reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, alter, or translate the Software,
  or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Software.
</li>
<li>
  To rent, lease, sell, sublicense, lend or otherwise
  transfer the Software or any portion thereof if not expressly allowed in the stipulations
  of this Agreement.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  <a name="commercial_license.output"></a>
  4.1. Generated Output
</h3>

The output/documentation generated under the <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a>
is free for any possible usage. In particular:
<ul>
<li>
  The Licensee may change the content of the generated files in any way,
  e.g. edit/remove some blocks, add own, etc.
</li>
<li>
  The generated/modified documents may be distributed with no limitations. 
</li>
</ul>

The <a href="#trial_license.output">distortion</a> of text visible
in the output documents generated under the <a href="#trial_license">Trial License</a>
will not happen under <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a>.

<h3>
  <a name="commercial_license.templates"></a>
  4.2. Templates
</h3>

The <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a>, which covers the Template Designer,
allows the Licensee:

<ul>
<li>
  To create/modify any templates.
</li>
<li>
  To distribute the <a href="#templates.custom">custom templates</a> to anyone else.
</li>
<li>
  To execute <a href="#templates.basic">basic/sample</a> templates provided with the Software. 
</li>
<li>
  To execute any <a href="#templates.custom">custom templates</a> created/modified under a
  <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial</a> or <a href="#trial_license">Trial</a> License.
</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> For <a href="#templates.cta">Commercial Template Applications</a> or
<a href="#templates.custom">custom templates</a> derived from them,
a separate license may be required that covers such an application (unless the same license for the Software
covers it).
<p>
For more information, please see <a href="#templates">Licensing of Templates</a>.

<h3>
  <a name="commercial_license.delivery"></a>
  4.3. Delivery
</h3>

The Software is only available through electronic delivery via Internet
(see <a href="http://www.filigris.com/downloads/" target="_blank">http://www.filigris.com/downloads/</a>).
The fully functional version of the Software is unlocked by the <i>license certificate</i> (key) sent to the user
via e-mail to the specified e-mail address. By request, the license certificate may also be sent by post.
<p>
The <b>license certificate</b> represents a plain-text file (license file), which contains
the information about the license and the Licensee.
The license file should be installed together with the Software according to the provided instruction.

<h3>
  <a name="commercial_license.maintenance_and_support"></a>
  4.4. Maintenance and Support
</h3>

The <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a> includes the following maintenance and support: 

<ul>
<li>
  Unlimited email support for a period of ONE YEAR.
  <p>
  This means that the user will get a reply on his/her e-mail normally during
  the same or the next working day, and we will keep corresponding until
  all questions or problems are fully resolved.
  <p>
</li>
<li>
  Free bugfix updates for the licensed version of the Software (see also <a href="#commercial_license.upgrade">below</a>).
  <p>
  If the user reports a bug and provides us with some information about how and where that bug happened 
  (in most cases, just a full Java Exception Stack Trace would suffice), normally, we can fix it and prepare
  an update during 2-3 following days.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  <a name="commercial_license.upgrade"></a>
  4.5. Upgrade Possibilities
</h3>

The Licensee of the <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a> is eligible for:
<ul>
<li>
  Cost free upgrades within the same generation (major version) of the licensed Software product.
  For example, if you purchase a license for the Software version 1.0, your license is automatically
  extended to versions 1.1, 1.5.1 and so on.
  <p>
  To upgrade to a new version within the same generation, all you need to do is to download
  the new software from our web-site, install it, and install on it your license certificate.
  You don't need to tell or ask us about anything.
  Each new software version is designed and tested to support any early issued licenses covering it.
  <p>
</li>
<li>
  Discount for the upgrade to the next major version of the licensed product (e.g. 1.x.x -> 2.x.x)
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  <a name="templates"></a>
  5. Licensing of Templates
</h2>

<h3>
  <a name="templates.basic"></a>
  5.1. Basic Templates
</h3>

These are any templates developed by Filigris Works (and included in the Software)
that are not designated as "<a href="#templates.cta">Commercial Template Applications</a>".
In particular, this category includes:
<ul>
  <li>Any sample templates</li>
  <li>The template applications, which implement some basic functionality essential for the entire product line.</li>
</ul>

Using of Basic Templates does not require any specific licensing.
You are equally free to modify such templates and base on them your own template applications
(for more details, see <a href="#templates.custom">Custom Templates</a>).

<h3>
  <a name="templates.cta"></a>
  5.2. Commercial Template Applications
</h3>

<i>Commercial Template Applications</i> are large template sets developed by Filigris Works
to implement certain general very complex tasks.

<p>
<table><tr><td class="note">
  For example, 
  <a href="http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/xsddoc/" target="_blank">DocFlex/XML XSDDoc</a>
  template set implements a high quality XML Schema Documentation Generator.
</td></tr></table>
<p>

The Commercial Template Applications provide functionality, which is typically offered by other companies
in the form of separate commercial software products (or specific features of them).
<p>
Each Commercial Template Application, whatever complex the task it implements, is just a set of DocFlex templates.
That means anything the template application generates is programmed entirely within
the templates themselves. The template interpreter, the template language and its embedded functions
provide only a general basic functionality needed for a particular application field (e.g. XML). 
<p>
Since the DocFlex templates always require a special interpreter for their execution,
all Commercial Template Applications are delivered as add-ins to each edition of the base product line.
<p>
On the other hand, because Commercial Template Applications actually solve some very complicated general tasks,
they require separate licensing.
<p>
Each Commercial Template Application has its own product name and version number.
The license for it is attached to those attributes.
<p>
The Commercial Template Applications may work under the following licenses:
<ol>
<li>
  <b><a href="#limited_free_license">Limited Free License</a></b>
  <p>
  This license is activated by default when no other licenses for the given Commercial Template Application have been found.
  It allows the Licensee to run the template application only in limited mode,
  which means that some template parameters are disabled so as only their default values can be used.
  That, effectively, limits the usage of certain important features controlled by those parameters.
  <p>
</li>
<li>
  <b><a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a></b>
  <p>
  This license unlocks all parameters and main templates of the Commercial Template Application.
  <p>
  The Licensee may use such a license with any edition of the main product
  containing the template interpreter/output generator, which will work without limitations under the default Free or 
  <a href="#limited_free_license">Limited Free</a> License covering the binary code of the main product.
  <p>
  The <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a> for the given Template Application allows
  the Licensee to use all the functionality implemented about the given application task
  (e.g. XML Schemas documentation generation).
  This includes all features both implemented in the templates themselves and supported by
  the template interpreter / output generator (e.g. generation of RTF output with the rendering of embedded HTML markup).
  <p>
  See also <a href="#multiple_licenses">Multiple Licenses</a>.
  <p>
</li>
<li>
  <b><a href="#trial_license">Trial License</a></b>
  <p>
  This license works the same as in the case of <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a>,
  however it imposes specific limitations.
  See <a href="#trial_license">Trial License</a> section for more details. 
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
  <a name="templates.custom"></a>
  5.3. Custom Templates
</h3>

Into this category fall any templates that have been created or modified the last time using the Template Designer
(included in the full edition of the given product line) working under a <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a>.
This includes:

<ol>
<li>
  Any templates developed completely by the users to solve their own specific tasks.
  <p>
  The <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a>
  imposes no specific limitations on possible usage of such templates.
  You may equally distribute them to anyone else.
  <p>
</li>
<li>
  Any templates derived from the <a href="#templates.basic">Basic Templates</a>
  (i.e. produced by modification of the templates included in the basic template sets).
  <p>
  The users are free to use/distribute such templates as needed.
  <p>
</li>
<li>
  Any templates derived from a particular <a href="#templates.cta">Commercial Template Applications</a>.
  <p>
  The execution of such templates still requires a 
  <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a>
  covering the initial <a href="#templates.cta">Commercial Template Applications</a>.
  <p>
  <table><tr><td class="note">
    The idea is this.
    We (Filigris Works) have developed some complex functionality in the form of a particular template application.
    The users are allowed to modify it and customize for their needs.
    However, we still need to be compensated for our work!
  </td></tr></table>
  <p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>
  <a name="multiple_licenses"></a>
  6. Multiple Licenses
</h2>

By its nature, DocFlex software can be described simultaneously in three different categories:
<ol>
<li>
  A software development tool, which manifests itself as the Template Designer (and the template language it visualizes).
</li>
<li>
  A run-time environment, which is the template interpreter/output generator.
</li>
<li>
  Template applications that implement particular useful tasks (for example,
  <a href="http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/xsddoc/" target="_blank">XML Schema Documentation Generator</a>). 
</li>
</ol>

Although, those pieces represent parts of the whole system, they are intended for very different purposes.
Therefore, not everyone needs all of them.
<p>
The goal of this licensing system is to allow people to pay exactly for what they want to use and
to remain the integrity of the whole software at the same time. Here is how it works.
<p>
A particular software package (edition) is always the same and may include lots of functionality.
Without the proper licenses that functionality works only in a reduced or demo mode
(see <a href="#limited_free_license">Limited Free License</a>).
When you want to use some specific features you buy a 
<a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a> that covers them.
If you later need another set of features, then you just buy another license.
Both (or more) licenses can be installed together.
As a result, you get a software that does what you need and pay only for what you use!
<p>
But, what will happen when some of those licenses have different types?

<p>
<table><tr><td class="note">
  For example, suppose you already have a full <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial License</a> for
  <a href="http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/xsddoc/" target="_blank">XSDDoc</a>
  template set.
  Now, you want to see how your XML schema documentation would look if you change something in the XSDDoc templates.
  You install a <a href="#trial_license">Trial License</a>
  for "<a href="http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/#docflex-xml-sdk">DocFlex/XML SDK</a>",
  which covers the Template Designer and modify the templates using it.
  Then, you run the modified XSDDoc.
  How may you use the result output documentation, then?
  According to which of those two license: <a href="#commercial_license">Commercial</a> or
  <a href="#trial_license">Trial</a>?
</td></tr></table>
<p>
The rule is the following.
<p>
<i>When to unlock all necessary features of the DocFlex software several specific
(not <a href="#limited_free_license">Limited Free</a>) licenses are installed
and some of those licenses have different types, the license that imposes maximum restrictions
and obligations will have the highest priority.</i>
<p>
The following table shows all matching license types and their priorities
(the higher the priority the more obligations the license imposes):
<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
    <td><b>License Type</b></td>

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
