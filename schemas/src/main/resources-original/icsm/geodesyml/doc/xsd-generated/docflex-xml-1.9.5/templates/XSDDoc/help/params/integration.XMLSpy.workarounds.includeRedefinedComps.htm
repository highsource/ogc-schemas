This parameter tells the integration if the redefined (original) components
are documented by XMLSpy.
<p>
Although all tested XMLSpy versions process redefinitions of XML schema components
(those specified within <code>&lt;xs:redefine&gt;</code> elements),
XMLSpy 2006 and early versions do not document separately the original components
(those being redefined) in the HTML output they generate.
<p>
To process such an HTML correctly, the integration needs to know about this.
<p>
<b>Default Value:</b>
<dl><dd>
The default value of this parameter is calculated from to the value of
the <i>"Integrations | XMLSpy | XMLSpy Version"</i> parameter.
So, in most cases you don't need to change it.
