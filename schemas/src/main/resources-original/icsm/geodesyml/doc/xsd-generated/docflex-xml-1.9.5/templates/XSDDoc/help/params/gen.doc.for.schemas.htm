This group of parameters allows you to select which XML schema files (and components defined in them)
will be documented.
<p>
The XML schema files you initially specify on the command line (or in the generator dialog)
are the primary XML files to be processed by the XSDDoc template set.
<p>
However, those initial XML schemas may call (reference) from themselves some other XML schema files
(via <code>&lt;xs:import&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;xs:include&gt;</code> and 
<code>&lt;xs:redefine&gt;</code> elements) and they, in turn, yet more extra schemas.
<p>
All those initial and referenced XML schema files will constitute the whole your XML schema project.
Generally, all of them must be loaded and processed in order to make sense of the declarations
specified in your initial XML schemas.
Some of the imported extra XML schemas may be the standard (and fairly big) ones used in other your projects.
<p>
So, do you need to document all the involved XML schemas?
If not, which ones?
That can be specified with the parameters in this group.
