With this parameter, you can add a precise list of XML schemas to be documented.
<p>
Each XML schema is specified in the list with its file name 
(the last name in the pathname's name sequence, e.g. "xml.xsd").
Multiple file names should be separated with the allowed item separator (e.g. newline).
<p>
This parameter works in addition to other schema selection parameters (above)
and won't override them.
