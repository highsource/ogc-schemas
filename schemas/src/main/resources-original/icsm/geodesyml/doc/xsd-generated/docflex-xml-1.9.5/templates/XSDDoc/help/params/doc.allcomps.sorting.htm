With this parameter you can specify the sorting order of components.
<p>
The parameter has the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>
  When the parameter is selected (<b><code>true</code></b>),
  the components will be sorted alphabetically by their names (ignoring letter case).
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  The component name is assumed to be that under which the component appears 
  (is referenced to) at the given documentation location.
  This is typically the component qualified name (which is the actual namespace prefix 
  plus the component local name). That, however, can be changed using 
  <i>"Show | Namespace Prefixes"</i> parameter.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  Additionally, in the case of a <i>local element</i>, the component name may also include
  a special extension used to distinguish the equally named local elements.
  For more details about this, please see <i>"Show | Local Element Extensions"</i> parameter.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10pt">
  When the parameter is unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>),
  the components will not be sorted.
  In that case they will follow in a certain "physical" order produced according to the following.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  When the components come from different XML schemas, first, they will be grouped by their schemas. 
  The ordering of those groups is determined by how the initial XML schemas (to be documented)
  have been specified as well as how these schemas import other XML schemas
  (see also <i>"Generate Details | For schemas"</i> parameter group for that matter).
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  Within a group belonging to the same XML schema, the components will follow in the same order 
  as they are defined in that schema.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  This gives you a possibility to specify a particular ordering of the components (e.g. elements)
  by yourself. Simply define the most important components (e.g. an XML document's root element)
  on the top of the XML schema. If you have several schemas to document, specify the most
  important of them the first. That will produce the component ordering as you wish
  (or something close to it).
</li>
</ul>
