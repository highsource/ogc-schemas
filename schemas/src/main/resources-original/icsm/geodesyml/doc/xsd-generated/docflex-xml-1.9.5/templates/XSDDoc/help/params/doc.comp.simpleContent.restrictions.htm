Specify whether to show all <b>actual facets</b> that restrict a possible value allowed for this simple content.
<p>
The list of actual facets is produced as follows.
<p>
First, the initial facets are collected by all types starting from the lowest one (which is either this component itself,
when it is a type, or the type directly assigned to this component, when it is an element or attribute) throughout
the chain of all its ancestor types (both global and anonymous) until the top ancestor passed or a derivation by list
or union reached.
<p>
Further, the produced sequence of facets is filtered so as the facets collected earliest
(that is defined in lower descendant types) remain and those overridden by them are removed.
In particular:
<ol>
<li>
  All <code>xs:pattern</code> facets will remain, because a value allowed for the given
  simple content must match all of them.
</li>
<li>
  The <code>xs:enumeration</code> facets will remain those that are defined in the same type,
  which is nearest to the given component.
</li>
<li>
  All other facets will override the same facets defined in the ancestor types.
</li>
</ol>
