Specify whether to quit XMLSpy.
<p>
Once all XML schemas have been processed and all diagrams generated,
XMLSpy is not needed any longer. Then, WSDLDoc issues a command to finish 
the XMLSpy integration.
What will happen with the running instance of XMLSpy
depends on the setting of this parameter:
<p>
<b><code>true</code></b> (selected)
<dl><dd>
This is the default mode (and default setting of this parameter).
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
As soon as the finishing XMLSpy command is issued, the integration
calls an XMLSpy API method to quit XMLSpy and waits until it returns.
After that, the processing of WSDLDoc templates (that is the generation of documentation)
continues.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
If you run WSDLDoc again (e.g. while using the generator GUI) with XMLSpy integration enabled,
a new XMLSpy instance will be launched and so on.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
One problem with this mode is that on <a href="http://www.winehq.org">Linux/Wine</a>
quitting of XMLSpy may raise an error (or even hang JVM).
In that case, you may try to unselect this parameter.
</dd></dl>

<b><code>false</code></b> (unselected)
<dl><dd>
The running instance of XMLSpy won't be quitted.
The processing of WSDLDoc templates continues as normally.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
If you run WSDLDoc from the generator GUI and then run it again (with XMLSpy integration enabled),
the same XMLSpy instance will be reused.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
When DocFlex/XML exits (that is the JVM running it), its use of the XMLSpy instance will be released.
However, the XMLSpy process itself will remain in memory running.
If <i>"Integrations | XMLSpy | Show XMLSpy"</i> parameter was selected before that, the XMLSpy IDE
will be visible still. So, you can use it and quit by standard means.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
On <a href="http://www.winehq.org">Linux/Wine</a>, releasing XMLSpy instance probably
doesn't work smoothly again.
But then, the Wine itself quits, so you won't see anything.
(The full XML schema documentation with the diagrams will be ready at that).
