Specify the version number of the XMLSpy installed on your system.
<p>
The default value of this parameter is obtained from the
<b><code>-m:XMLSPY_VERSION</code></b> option specified on the generator command line.
<p>
Here you can override it and specify a different XMLSpy version number,
which will be used only by WSDLDoc templates.
<p>
Note that the XMLSpy version number is not used by the XMLSpy integration itself.
Rather, it is used essentially to calculate the default values of the 
<i>"Workarounds"</i> parameters (which allows you to not bother yourself much
about their meanings).
