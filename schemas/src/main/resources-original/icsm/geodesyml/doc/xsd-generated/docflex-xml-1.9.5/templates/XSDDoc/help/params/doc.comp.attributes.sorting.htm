This parameter specifies how the attributes should be sorted.
<p>
When selected (<b><code>true</code></b>) the attributes will be sorted 
in alphabetic order of their qualified names (with letter case ignored).
<p>
When unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>) the attributes will follow according
to some <b><i>natural order</i></b> determined by how and where those attributes are declared:
<ul>
<li>
In the simplest case, when all attributes are declared within the same component,
that will be exactly the order of their declarations.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10pt">
When the given component (whose attributes are documented) is based on other components,
some of the attributes may be inherited from them.
Moreover, the ancestor components may block certain attributes declared in their own ancestors.
In that case, the result attribute ordering will appear from the subsequent
interpretation of all involved components.
</li>
</ul>
