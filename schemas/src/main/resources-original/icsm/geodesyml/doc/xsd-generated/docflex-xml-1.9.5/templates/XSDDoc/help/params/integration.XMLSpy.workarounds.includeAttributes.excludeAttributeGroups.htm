This parameter informs the integration that the local attributes defined within global attribute
groups are not documented in the HTML output file generated by XMLSpy.
<p>
This problem occurs in XMLSpy 2006-2007. 
Although these XMLSpy versions do depict all local attributes on the diagrams and even generates hyperlinks for them,
those local attributes that are defined within global attribute groups are actually never documented separately
in the HTML output produced by XMLSpy.
(So, the diagram hyperlinks to them in fact lead to nowhere!)
<p>
To process such an HTML correctly, the integration needs to know about that omission.

<b>Default Value:</b>
<dl><dd>
The default value of this parameter is calculated from to the value of
the <i>"Integrations | XMLSpy | XMLSpy Version"</i> parameter.
So, in most cases you don't need to change it.
