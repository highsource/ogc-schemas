This parameter specifies how the content elements should be sorted.
<p>
When selected (<b><code>true</code></b>) the elements will be sorted 
in alphabetic order of their qualified names (with letter case ignored).
<p>
When unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>) the elements will follow according
to some <b><i>natural order</i></b> determined by how and where those elements are declared:
<ul>
<li>
In the simplest case, when all content elements are declared within the same component,
that will be exactly the order of their declarations.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10pt">
When the given component (whose content elements are documented) is based on other components,
some of its content elements may be inherited from the ancestor components.
In that case, the result element ordering will appear from the subsequent
interpretation of all involved components.
</li>
</ul>
