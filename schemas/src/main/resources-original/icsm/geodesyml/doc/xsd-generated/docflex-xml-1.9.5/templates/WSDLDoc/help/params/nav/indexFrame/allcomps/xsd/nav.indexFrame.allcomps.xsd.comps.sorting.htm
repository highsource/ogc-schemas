Specify the sorting order of XSD components (within each component type group).
<p>
The parameter has the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>
  When it is selected (<b><code>true</code></b>),
  the XSD components will be sorted alphabetically by their names (ignoring letter case).
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  The component name is assumed to be that under which the component appears 
  (is referenced to) at the given documentation location.
  This is typically the component qualified name (which is the actual namespace prefix 
  plus the component local name). That, however, can be changed using 
  <i>"Show | Namespace Prefixes"</i> parameter.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  Additionally, in the case of <i>local elements</i>, the component name may also include
  a special extension used to distinguish the equally named local elements.
  For more details about this, please see <i>"Show | Local Element Extensions"</i> parameter.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10pt">
  When the parameter is unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>),
  the XSD components are not sorted.
  In that case they will follow in a certain "physical" order produced according to the following.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  When components come from different XML schemas, first, they will be grouped by their schemas. 
  The ordering of those groups is determined by what WSDL/XSD files have been specified initially
  and how they reference (e.g. import) other WSDL/XSD files.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  Within a group of components that belong to the same XML schema, they will follow in the same order 
  as they are defined in that schema.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  This allows you to control a particular ordering of components (e.g. elements)
  by yourself. Simply define the most important components (e.g. an XML document's root element)
  on the top of the XML schema. If you have several schemas to document, specify the most
  important of them the first. That will produce the component ordering as you wish
  (or something close to it).
</li>
</ul>
