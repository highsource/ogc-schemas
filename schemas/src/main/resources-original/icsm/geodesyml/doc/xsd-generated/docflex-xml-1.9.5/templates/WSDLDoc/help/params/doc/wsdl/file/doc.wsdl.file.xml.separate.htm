Specify whether the WSDL file source must be placed in a separate HTML file.
<p>
Some WSDL files may be large enough.
When XML source of such a file is included in the WSDL File Overview page 
(along with the description and definitions summaries), that page becomes
difficult to manage in a web-browser. 
This parameter allows you to split it into two pages:
<ul>
<li>
When the parameter is selected (<b><code>true</code></b>),
the WSDL file source will be reproduced in a separate page 
(<code>wsdl-source.html</code> file).
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10pt">
When the parameter is unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>),
the WSDL file source will be included at the end the WSDL File Overview page.
</li>
</ul>
