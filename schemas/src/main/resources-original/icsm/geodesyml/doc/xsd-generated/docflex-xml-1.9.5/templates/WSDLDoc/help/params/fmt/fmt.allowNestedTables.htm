Specify if the generated output may contain nested tables.
<p>
WSDLDoc templates frequently use tables as layouts in order to fit data better on a page.
In certain cases, however, this leads to the situation when one table is nested into a cell of another table.
For some RTF reader, this may cause a problem.
<p>
Although RTF specification since v1.6 does support nested tables (as well as MS Word 2000 and the later),
some modern and important RTF readers (such as OpenOffice.org 2.0) break on them.
<p>
To work around this problem, all WSDLDoc templates that use nested tables also contain alternative sections without them.
Such sections will be activated instead of the primary ones, when this parameter is unchecked.
Although, without nested tables some pieces of the documentation may look less compact and sleek,
this still allows to generate a quite decently looking output.
<p>
Please, uncheck this parameter when your destination RTF reader has problems with nested tables!
