Specify whether to run OxygenXML concurrently using multiple processing threads.
<p>
When there are a number of independent XML schemas to be processed by OxygenXML,
that processing can be accelerated several times by running multiple instances of
OxygenXML for different schemas at once. This parameter enables such a processing.
<p>
The nested parameter specifies how many parallel threads are allowed.
