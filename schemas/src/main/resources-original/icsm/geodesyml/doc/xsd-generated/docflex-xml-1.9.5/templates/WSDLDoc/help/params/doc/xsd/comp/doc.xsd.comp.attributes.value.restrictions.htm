Specify whether to show all <b>actual facets</b> that restrict a possible value allowed for this attribute.
<p>
The list of actual facets is produced as the following.
<p>
First, the initial facets are collected by all types starting from the type assigned to the attribute
throughout the chain of all its ancestor types (both global and anonymous) until the top ancestor passed
or a derivation by list or union reached.
<p>
Further, the produced sequence of facets is filtered so as the facets collected earliest
(that is defined in lower descendant types) remain and those overridden by them are removed.
In particular:
<ol>
<li>
  All <code>xs:pattern</code> facets will remain, because the attribute value must match all of them.
</li>
<li>
  The <code>xs:enumeration</code> facets will remain those that are defined in the same type,
  which is either the attribute type itself or the one nearest to it.
</li>
<li>
  All other facets will override the same facets defined in the ancestor types.
</li>
</ol>
