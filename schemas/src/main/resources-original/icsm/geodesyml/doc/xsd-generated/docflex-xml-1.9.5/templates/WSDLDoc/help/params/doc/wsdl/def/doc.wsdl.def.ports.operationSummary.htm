Specify whether to include the <b><i>Operation Summary</i></b> section that lists all <b>operations</b>
provided by the port.
<p>
That operation summary replicates a similar summary in Binding Documentation (see parameter:
<i>"Details | WSDL Definition | Operation Summary"</i>).
<p>
The summary information about each operation includes its name and description (the first sentence).
The description text comes from the <code>&lt;wsdl:documentation&gt;</code> element found by the path:
<dl><dd>
<code>wsdl:binding/wsdl:operation/wsdl:documentation</code>
</dd></dl>
However, when that description is absent, an alternative description may be used,
which is searched for according to the settings in the parameter group:
<i>"Details | WSDL Definition | Alternative Descriptions | Operation"</i>.

<p>
<b>See Also Parameters:</b>
<ul>
<li><i>Details | WSDL Definition | Operation Summary</i></li>
<li><i>Details | WSDL Definition | Alternative Descriptions | Operation</i></li>
</ul>
