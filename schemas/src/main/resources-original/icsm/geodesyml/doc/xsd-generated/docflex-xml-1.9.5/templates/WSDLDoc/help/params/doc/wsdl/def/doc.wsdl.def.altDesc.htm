With these parameters you can select where to look for <b>alternative descriptions</b> of some WSDL definitions.
<p>
WSDL has a special <code>&lt;wsdl:documentation&gt;</code> element to specify descriptions of WSDL definitions.
WSDLDoc does use these elements to obtain various descriptions, which are placed in the generated documentation.
<p>
However, some descriptions may be absent and need to be inherited from closely related WSDL definitions
(e.g. an operation binding may have the same description as the corresponding operation in a portType).
<p>
Besides that, not all WSDL files use <code>&lt;wsdl:documentation&gt;</code>
elements to convey actual descriptions/documentation.

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:12pt">
<tr><td style="font-family: Dialog; font-size:12pt">
For instance, the WSDL file describing the 
<i>"<a href="http://developer.ebay.com/webservices/latest/ebaySvc.wsdl">eBay Trading API</a>"</i> 
defines lots of operations, which are documented pretty well in the same file.
However, that documentation is not specified in the corresponding
<code>&lt;wsdl:operation&gt;</code> elements (via <code>&lt;wsdl:documentation&gt;</code>).
Rather, it is found in annotations of XSD components (found in the XML schema embedded in that WSDL)
that define the data types of the operation input/output messages.
</td></tr>
</table>

So, although for such WSDL files the proper documentation can be generated,
the relevant descriptions must be looked for in different places and copied from there.

<p>
This parameter group allows you to specify that.
