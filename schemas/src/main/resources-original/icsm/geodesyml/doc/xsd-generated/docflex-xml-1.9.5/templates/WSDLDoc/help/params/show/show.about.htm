Specify whether to generate the <i>"About"</i> section added at the bottom of each generated document.
<p>
This section shows certain information about
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/">DocFlex/XML</a>
software and <a href="http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/wsdldoc/">WSDLDoc</a>
template set.
<p>
The content of the <i>"About"</i> section is generated entirely by the following template:
<dl><dd>
<code>WSDLDoc/lib/about.tpl</code>
</dd></dl>
Once you acquire a full license for
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/#docflex-xml-sdk">DocFlex/XML SDK</a>,
you will be able to modify this template as you wish (as well as all other WSDLDoc templates)
so as to generate in the <i>"About"</i> section something of your own. For instance,
to insert you company info, logotype, your copyright statement etc.
