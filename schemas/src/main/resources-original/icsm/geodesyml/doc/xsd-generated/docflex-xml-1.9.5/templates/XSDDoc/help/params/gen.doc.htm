This group of parameters controls the overall content of the generated XML schema documentation.
<p>
The XML schema documentation generated with <i>"XSDDoc"</i> template set is built of big independent
<b><i>documentation blocks</i></b>.
<p>
In framed HTML documentation, each of those blocks becomes a separate HTML file (or page),
which is displayed in the <i>"details"</i> frame.
<p>
In single file (HTML or RTF) documentation, the blocks become separate sections that follow one after another.
In RTF each of those sections also has its own page header/footer.
<p>
There are following types of documentation blocks:
<ul>
<li>
  <b><i>Overview Summary</i></b>: This block is generated only once for the whole documentation.
</li>
<li>
  <b><i>All Component Summary</i></b>: This block (also generated only once) contains summaries
  of all schema components of the specified types throughout all XML schemas being documented.
</li>
<li>
  <b><i>Namespace Overview</i></b>: This block is generated for every namespace being documented.
</li>
<li>
  <b><i>Schema Overview</i></b>: This is generated for every XML schema.
</li>
<li>
  <b><i>Component Documentation</i></b>: This is the most sophisticated type of blocks that can be generated
  for all types of global components as well as all local elements.
</li>
<li>
  <b><i>XML Namespace Bindings</i></b>: A special report, which can be generated only once.
</li>
</ul>

Using parameters in this group, you can specify which of those blocks must be generated and
for which XML schema components (e.g. <i>Component Documentation</i> blocks).
<p>
What exactly is included in particular those blocks should be specified in the <b><i>"Details"</i></b> parameter group.
