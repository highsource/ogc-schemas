Select the graphics format of the diagrams generated by XMLSpy.
<p>
<u>Possible Choices</u>:
<p>
<i>"PNG"</i>
<blockquote style="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:10pt">
All diagrams will be in PNG formats.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
This is the default format. It is best for HTML documentation. (However, in RTF/PDF documentation it will work as well.)
</blockquote>

<i>"EMF"</i>
<blockquote style="margin-top:10pt">
The diagrams will be generated in <b>EMF</b> format.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
This format is more suitable for printable RTF/PDF documentation.
(In case of HTML, the diagrams will be generated in EMF as well,
however, whether you can see them will depend on your HTML browser.)
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
<b>Important:</b>
The generation of diagrams in EMF format is possible only since XMLSpy <b>2009</b> or later.
(Although, XMLSpy itself supported EMF much earlier, they provided the Java API for it only since 2009.)
Therefore, if you have an earlier version of XMLSpy and select "EMF" in this parameter,
only PNG graphics will be generated instead.
