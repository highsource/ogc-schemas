With this parameter you can specify the sorting order of WSDL definitions.
<p>
The meaning of this parameter is the following:
<ul>
<li>
  When it is selected (<b><code>true</code></b>),
  WSDL definitions will be sorted alphabetically by their names (ignoring letter case).
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  The definition name is assumed to be that under which the definition appears 
  (is referenced to) at the given documentation location.
  This is typically the definition qualified name (which is the actual namespace prefix 
  plus the definition local name). That, however, can be changed using 
  <i>"Show | Namespace Prefixes"</i> parameter.
</li>
<li style="margin-top:10pt">
  When the parameter is unselected (<b><code>false</code></b>),
  WSDL definitions are not sorted.
  In that case they will follow in a certain "physical" order produced according to the following.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  When definitions come from different WSDL files, first, they will be grouped by their containing files. 
  The ordering of those groups is determined by what WSDL files are specified initially
  and how they import other WSDL files.
  <p style="margin-top:10pt">
  Within a group of WSDL definitions belonging to the same WSDL file, they will follow in the same order 
  as they are defined in that file.
</li>
</ul>
