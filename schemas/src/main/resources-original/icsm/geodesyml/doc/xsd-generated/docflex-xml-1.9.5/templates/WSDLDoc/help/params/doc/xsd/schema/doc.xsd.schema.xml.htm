Specifies whether to reproduce the XML source of the whole XML schema.
<p>
It appears as a part of the documentation
with the XML markup highlighted with special colors and the values of some XML attributes
hyperlinked to the related sections of the documentation.
<p>
The reproduced XML source is included as a section of the <i>Schema Overview</i> page/block.
In case of framed HTML documentation, it may be also placed in a separate page (HTML file),
which is controlled by the nested parameter: <i>"Separate File"</i>.
<p>
Although the reproduced XML source closely replicates the real one, it may be slightly different.
For instance, ordering of XML attribute may be not the same. 
Additionally, <code>&lt;xs:annotation&gt;</code> elements may be intentionally omitted,
which is controlled by the nested parameter: <i>"Remove &lt;xs:annotation&gt;"</i>

<p>
<u>Possible Choices</u>:
<p>
<i>"all"</i>
<dl><dd>
The XML schema source will be reproduced in any case.
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
When the XML schema is embedded in a WSDL file, 
only the <code>&lt;xs:schema&gt;</code> element and its content will be reproduced.
However, since it is still a part the WSDL file, whose entire XML source may be reproduced separately
(see the parameter <i>"Details | WSDL File Overview | XML Source"</i>),
that will lead to the duplication.
</dd></dl>

<i>"XSD file only"</i>
<dl><dd>
The XML schema source will be reproduced only for XSD files
(i.e. when the XML schema is defined in a separate XML file).
<p style="margin-top:10pt">
In that case, the entire XML schema file will be reproduced.
</dd></dl>

<i>"none"</i>
<dl><dd>
The XML source of the schema will not be reproduced.
</dd></dl>

<p>
<b>Nested Parameters:</b>
<dl><dd>
Control how the reproduced XML source will look, where it is placed and what it will include.
</dd></dl>
