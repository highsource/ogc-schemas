Specify how many OxygenXML instances can be run at once.
<p>
You can set any number here 
(and so many instances will be invoked when there are XML schemas to process).
However, the actual performance improvement depends on how many
concurrent threads are physically supported by your system 
(e.g. the number of processor cores, hyperthreading etc.)
<p>
That you can specify with a special value <b><code>'auto'</code></b> (default).
In that case, the maximal number of OxygenXML threads will be estimated automatically
according to the number of available processors returned by JVM.
