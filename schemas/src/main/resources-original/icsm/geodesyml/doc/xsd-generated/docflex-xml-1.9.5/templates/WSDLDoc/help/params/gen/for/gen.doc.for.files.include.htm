With this parameter, you can add a precise list of WSDL/XSD files to be documented.
<p>
Each file is specified in the list with its name 
(the last name in the pathname's name sequence, e.g. "xml.xsd").
Multiple file names should be separated with the item separator (';' or newline).
<p>
This parameter works in addition to other file selection parameters (above)
and won't override them.
