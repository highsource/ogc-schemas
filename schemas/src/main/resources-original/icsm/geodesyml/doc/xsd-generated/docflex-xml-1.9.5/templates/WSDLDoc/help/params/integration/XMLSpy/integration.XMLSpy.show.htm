Specify whether XMLSpy application (IDE) should show up,
when it is called from DocFlex to process the XML schemas.
<p>
When <i>"Integrations | XMLSpy | Quit XMLSpy"</i> parameter was unselected (<code>false</code>),
the XMLSpy IDE will remain visible even after finishing DocFlex/XML.
So, you can use it and quit by standard means.
