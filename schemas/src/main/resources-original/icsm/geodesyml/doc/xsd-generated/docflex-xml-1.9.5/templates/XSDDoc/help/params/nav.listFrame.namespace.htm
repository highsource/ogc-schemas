This parameter specifies whether to generate <b><i>Namespace Navigation Pages</i></b>.
<p>
Such a page is generated for every documented namespace
and may list all XML schemas targeting that namespace as well as
all global components and local elements that belong to the namespace.
<p>
The component list is broken into separate groups according to component types (e.g. elements, complexTypes etc).
Using corresponding nested parameters, you can specify the components of which types should be included in the list.
<p>
The sorting order of components within a type group is controlled by the <i>"Sorting"</i> nested parameter.
